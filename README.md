This library and demo code is used to allow you to easily create fancy looking animations on your 2019 Unexpected Maker badge.

To flash your badge with new code, you'll need to install these tiny85 board files from the Arduino Board Manager

And then select the Tiny85 from the board list, and set the internal clock to 8MHz, and select your programming board and port:
